This example demonstrates how to use [Voilà](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) on Binder.

## Configuration

If you would like to use the same configuration as this repository but for another project, check out the following steps:

1. Make sure the repository is publicly available (on GitHub, Gitlab or as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com)
2. Define the dependencies in [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml). `requirements.txt` is also supported. In the dependency file, add `voila`.
3. Go to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) and enter the URL of the repository.
4. In `Path to a notebook file`, select `URL` and use the Voilà endpoint: `voila/render/path/to/notebook.ipynb`
5. Click `Launch`.
6. Binder will trigger a new build if this is the first launch (or if there have been new changes since
   the last build). This might take a few minutes to complete. If an image is already available,
   the server will be able to start within a few seconds.

Here is an overview of the Binder configuration on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org):

For more details, check out the Voilà documentation on https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy.html#deployment-on-binder

## JupyterLab Preview Extension for Voilà

The JupyterLab Preview Extension for Voilà should normally be automatically available, since Binder now defaults to JupyterLab 3.0.

For consistency, you can add `jupyterlab=3` as a dependency in `environment.yml`.
